Architecture:
        In compress40.c we handle compression and decompression and calling all
        of our helper functions in the correct order

        in fileHandler.c we have functions that deal with writing to and reading
        from files

        in cvRGB.c we have functions that do transformations on image spaces
        with equations

        in chromaDCT.c we have functions that deal with chromatization and
        discrete cosine transformations of image data
        
        in pack.c we have functions that deal with packing and unpacking 
        keywords
        
        in bitpack.c we handle bit arithmetic
